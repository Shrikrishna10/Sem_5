 Write a Machine code:
- check if a given 8 bit number is a 2 out of 5 code
- for most significant 3 bits must be 0
- in the least significant 5 bits, there must only be 2 1's

 assume there are 2 elements in the memory as a[0] and  a[1]  if a [0] is lesser than a[1] swap the elements  

arrange an array in ascending order using bubble sort
