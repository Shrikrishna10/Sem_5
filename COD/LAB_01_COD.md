We have 32 registers in the RV32 processor.

when we do .half we get half the register to fill up with ffff this is the way the half words are stored while avoiding the sign issues so as to make sure that the system doesnt make the unsigned numbers signed characters??

the load instruction for the loading of the signed and unsigned values are different

lhu -> this is the syntax for the unsigned # 


for next lab practice finish trying out some codes and play around in ripes 
go through n understand the lil indian and big indian properly
