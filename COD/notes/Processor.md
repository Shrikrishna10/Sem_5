- Memory reference instructions: load word(lw) & store word (sw)
- The arithmetic logical instructions: add, sub, and, or
- The conditional branch instruction: branch if equal(beq)

To make a Processor we need an ALU, register, mux, gates and some other files made prior
made some basic ALU 1 bit MUX 4 bits for 2 inputs and a REG for 4 bits 

#search need to learn everything that is being done right now
