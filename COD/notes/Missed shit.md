# Instruction for Making Decisions

the instruction is similar to an **if statement with a go-to.**
## Conditional Branches:
A instruction that tests a value & that allows for a subsequent transfer of control to a new address in the program based on the outcome of the test.

#### Question
In the following code segment, f, g, h, i, and j are variables. If the five
variables f through j correspond to the five registers x19 through x23,
what is the compiled RISC-V code for this C if statement?
if (i == j) f = g + h; else f = g âˆ’ h;
![[Pasted image 20240829114557.png]]
here we need to compare i & j and make decisions on the opposite outcome since we can jump to else if the condition is not meet

#### Question
Loops : for iterating a computation
Here is a traditional loop in C:
while (save[i] == k)
i += 1;
Assume that i and k correspond to registers x22 and x24 and the base of
the array save is in x25. What is the RISC-V assembly code corresponding
to this C code?

signed 13-bits are stored in 12 bits how? #search #todo #important 

## Addressing in Branches
- RISC-v branch instructions use an RISC-v instruction format with a 12-bit immediate. This format can represent branch addresses from -4096 to 4094, in multiples of 2 as it is only possible to branch to even addresses.
bne x10, x11, 2000 ; rs1=x10, rs2= x11 & imm[12:0] = 0x7D0= 0 0111 1101 000 ==0==
the above instruction
