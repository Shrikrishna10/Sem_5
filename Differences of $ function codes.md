In SystemVerilog (SV), `$display`, `$strobe`, `$monitor`, and `$write` are all system tasks used for displaying information during simulation, but they have different functionalities and use cases. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### `$display`

- **Purpose**: Prints a formatted message to the simulation log.
- **Behavior**: Outputs the message immediately when the statement is executed. It does not wait for the end of the simulation time step.
- **Usage**: Typically used for general purpose logging and debugging.
- **Example**:
    
    systemverilog
    

- `$display("Current time: %0t, Signal value: %b", $time, signal);`
    

### `$strobe`

- **Purpose**: Similar to `$display`, but it schedules the output to occur at the end of the current time step.
- **Behavior**: The message is printed at the end of the current simulation time step, just before any new events are processed.
- **Usage**: Useful for ensuring that the message reflects the values after all other events in the current time step have been resolved.
- **Example**:
    
    systemverilog
    

- `$strobe("At time %0t, signal value is %b", $time, signal);`
    

### `$monitor`

- **Purpose**: Continuously monitors and displays the value of variables or expressions whenever any of them change.
- **Behavior**: Automatically triggers an output whenever any monitored expression changes its value. The message is displayed at the end of the time step when a change is detected.
- **Usage**: Ideal for debugging and observing changes in variables over time without having to insert multiple `$display` statements.
- **Example**:
    
    systemverilog
    

- `$monitor("At time %0t, signal1: %b, signal2: %b", $time, signal1, signal2);`
    

### `$write`

- **Purpose**: Prints a formatted message to the simulation log without adding a newline character at the end.
- **Behavior**: The message is printed immediately when the statement is executed, similar to `$display`, but does not append a newline character.
- **Usage**: Useful for creating formatted output that doesn’t automatically end with a newline, allowing for more control over the output format.
- **Example**:
    
    systemverilog
    

- `$write("Current value: %d", value);`
    

### Summary

- **`$display`**: Outputs message immediately, with a newline at the end.
- **`$strobe`**: Outputs message at the end of the current time step, with a newline at the end.
- **`$monitor`**: Continuously outputs messages when monitored variables change, with a newline at the end.
- **`$write`**: Outputs message immediately, without adding a newline at the end.

Each of these system tasks is designed to help with debugging and monitoring your simulation in different ways.

In the context of the stratified event queue in SystemVerilog simulations, the behavior of `$display`, `$strobe`, `$monitor`, and `$write` can be understood in terms of when and how these system tasks interact with the simulation’s event queue. Here’s how each of them behaves with respect to the event queue:

### Stratified Event Queue Overview

SystemVerilog simulations use a stratified event queue to manage the scheduling and execution of events at different time steps. The event queue has several levels:

1. **Active level**: Immediate tasks and statements currently being executed.
2. **Deferred level**: Tasks and statements scheduled to execute later within the same time step.
3. **Event queue**: Scheduled events and tasks that will execute in future simulation time steps.

### `$display`

- **Behavior**: `$display` outputs its message immediately when the statement is executed. It does not consider the stratified event queue directly; it prints at the active level.
- **Event Queue Interaction**: The output appears in the simulation log immediately, without waiting for the end of the time step. It’s executed as part of the current active level processing.

### `$strobe`

- **Behavior**: `$strobe` schedules its output to occur at the end of the current time step. It waits until all other events in the current time step, including deferred events, have been processed.
- **Event Queue Interaction**: `$strobe` is executed as part of the deferred level, ensuring that the output reflects the final state of variables after all current time step events have been processed.

### `$monitor`

- **Behavior**: `$monitor` continuously watches the monitored variables and prints a message whenever any of them change. The output is triggered at the end of the time step, similar to `$strobe`.
- **Event Queue Interaction**: The `$monitor` output is also part of the deferred level. Changes in monitored variables cause the output to be scheduled to occur at the end of the current time step, reflecting the final state of the monitored variables.

### `$write`

- **Behavior**: `$write` outputs its message immediately when the statement is executed, similar to `$display`, but without appending a newline.
- **Event Queue Interaction**: The output appears in the simulation log immediately at the active level, just like `$display`, without waiting for the end of the current time step or considering deferred events.

### Summary with Respect to Stratified Event Queue

- **`$display`**: Executes immediately in the active level of the event queue, showing the state of variables as they are at that moment.
- **`$strobe`**: Executes at the end of the current time step, ensuring the output reflects the final state of the simulation variables after all current time step events.
- **`$monitor`**: Continuously checks for changes in monitored variables and outputs the state at the end of the current time step when any of the monitored variables change.
- **`$write`**: Executes immediately in the active level, similar to `$display`, but does not include a newline character at the end.

Understanding these behaviors helps in debugging and verifying designs by allowing precise control over when and how simulation outputs are generated in relation to the event queue.

i have four regions which are active region, inactive region, NBA region, postponed region

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In the context of simulation and the stratified event queue, regions like Active, Inactive, Non-Blocking Assignment (NBA), and Postponed represent different stages and types of events and tasks in the simulation cycle. Here's a detailed look at each region and how they relate to the system tasks `$display`, `$strobe`, `$monitor`, and `$write`:

### 1. **Active Region**

- **Description**: The Active region contains tasks and statements that are currently being executed. This is where the main simulation activities are processed in real time.
- **Interaction with System Tasks**:
    - **`$display`**: Executes in the Active region. Outputs are generated immediately based on the current values of variables.
    - **`$write`**: Also executes in the Active region. Outputs are generated immediately without a newline, reflecting the state at the moment of execution.

### 2. **Inactive Region**

- **Description**: The Inactive region represents the time when simulation is not actively processing events or tasks, typically in between time steps or when no events are scheduled for execution.
- **Interaction with System Tasks**:
    - System tasks like `$display`, `$strobe`, `$monitor`, and `$write` do not typically interact directly with the Inactive region, as this region is a passive state where no active processing occurs.

### 3. **Non-Blocking Assignment (NBA) Region**

- **Description**: The NBA region is where non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are processed. These assignments are scheduled to take effect at the end of the current time step.
- **Interaction with System Tasks**:
    - **`$strobe`**: Executes at the end of the NBA region, ensuring that the output reflects the final values after all non-blocking assignments have been processed.
    - **`$monitor`**: Can reflect changes that occur during the NBA region, but the actual output occurs at the end of the time step after NBA assignments are complete.

### 4. **Postponed Region**

- **Description**: The Postponed region is for tasks and events that are scheduled to be executed in future time steps, which are not yet ready for processing.
- **Interaction with System Tasks**:
    - System tasks like `$display`, `$strobe`, `$monitor`, and `$write` do not execute in the Postponed region directly. Instead, these tasks are scheduled or triggered based on when they are invoked and their respective timing requirements.

### Summary of Interaction

- **`$display`**: Executes immediately in the Active region, reflecting the current state of variables.
- **`$write`**: Similar to `$display`, it executes immediately in the Active region without appending a newline.
- **`$strobe`**: Executes at the end of the current time step, after the NBA region, ensuring the output reflects the final state of variables.
- **`$monitor`**: Continuously monitors and prints values at the end of the time step, considering changes during the NBA region.

By understanding these interactions with different regions, you can better manage how and when information is displayed or monitored in your simulation. This helps in ensuring that the output correctly reflects the state of your simulation at the desired points in the event queue.
