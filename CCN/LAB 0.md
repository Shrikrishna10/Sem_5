## COD
say we have a C application, the 1st thing that is done is compilation where we convert the programming language into assembly language. This is a intermediate step where we get something that can be considered as a machine language but this cannot be recognised by the hardware so we need an assembler to convert it into binary. The assembler needs ISA.

- 1 Double Word is 64 bits which is 8 bytes
- 1 Word is 32 Bits which is 4 bytes.
- 1 Half Word is 16 Bits which is 2 bytes
- 1 Byte is 8 Bits
