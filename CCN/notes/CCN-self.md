# What is a Network?
A network is simply defined as an arrangement of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines.
- But our definitions can be tailored in such a fashion as follows:
	- a group or system of interconnected people or things.

# What is a Computer Network?
A computer network can be defined as a group or groups of interconnected nodes or systems that share and/or exchange data and resources.
	Here the systems can be computational devices or other edge devices.
- These networks follow certain pre-set rules which is recognised by both the sender and receiver systems.
	- This system of rules are collectively called the communication protocols.
- These networks can be either physical or wireless.

- It is a graph consisting of end-systems or hosts connected to one another via communication links & some **packet switches** 
- End-Systems or hosts run applications which generate or receive data in the form of packets(i.e. collection of bits.).
- A sequence of packet switches & communication links are called route or path.
- A computer network is usually administered by one entity which configures & maintains the operation.
>[!Note]
>Hosts connect to the internet via ISPs.



# How does a Computer Network Work???
Nodes & links are the basic building blocks in computer networking. 
- A **network node** may be a Data Communication equipment(**DCE**) such as:
	- Modem, Hub, switch, Data Terminal equipment(DTE) such as 2 or more computers, printers, etc.
- A **link** refers to the **transmission media** connecting 2 nodes. It can be:
	- Cable wires, optical fibres, free space.
#### Extra
In a working computer network, nodes follow a set of rules or protocols that define how to send and receive electronic data via the links. The computer network architecture defines the design of these physical and logical components. It provides the specifications for the networkâ€™s physical components, functional organization, protocols, and procedures.

# What do Computer Networks do? 
Created for the Military, an efficient data transmission method for time critical information.
It is the biggest boon to society when it was adapted for it current applications. 
Nowadays they are more than a connectivity set-up, and do more than just transfer information over a long distance the same way as it was originally intended to.
The things that the network carries may not have changed but the use of this has.
Modern Computer Networks can:
1. Operate virtually
2. Integrate on a **large scale**
3. Respond quickly to changing conditions
4. Provide Data Security.
	1. Originally the internet didn't have a proper security system but a lot of the protocols now days have made sure that your data on the internet is encrypted.

# Computer Network Architecture:
1. Client - Server Architecture:
	In this type of Computer Network, nodes may be servers or clients. Server nodes provide resources like memory, processing power, data to client nodes. Server nodes may also manage client node behaviour. Clients may communicate with each other, but they do not share resources. For Eg. some computer devices in enterprise networks store data & config settings. These devices are the servers in the network. Clients may access this data by making a request to the server machine.
2. Peer-to-Peer Architecture:
	In Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, connected computers have equal powers and privileges. There is no central server for coordination. Each device in the computer network can act as either client or server. Each peer may share some of its resources, like memory and processing power, with the entire computer network. For example, some companies use P2P architecture to host memory-consuming applications, such as 3-D graphic rendering, across multiple digital devices.


# What is the Internet?
The **Internet** is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks & electronic devices that communicate with each other using an established set of protocols.

Above is a visualisation of the internet.

One way is to describe the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, **the basic hardware and software components that make up the Internet**. Another way is to describe the Internet in terms of a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications. #todo 

# Who owns/controls the Internet?
- ISP (Internet Service Provider): is a business entity or company which provides internet access to the end-systems in which return for a subscription fee.
- The place where end-systems connect to an ISP is referred to as point-of-presence(PoP).
- The number of PoPs (typically in 1000s) held by an ISP tells about its outreach in the internet.
- PoP consists of routers, link layer switches, MPLS and communication links.
- ISP Eg: Telecom operators, Cable TV operators, Fibre optic operators.

## Revenue Generation is as follows:
- End users pay access ISPs.
- Access ISPs pay to regional ISPs
- Regional ISPs pay to Teir 1 ISPs
-  #todo not sure if it is important moving on
