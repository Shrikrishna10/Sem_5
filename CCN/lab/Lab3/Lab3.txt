1.What was the transport protocol used for DNS queries? Give source and destination port numbers for each query in the experiment. 
	UDP is used for DNS queries.
	a. Source = 54207 Destination = 53
	b. Source = 50960 Destination = 53
	c. Source = 53 Destination = 62371
	d. Source =  Destination = 

2.Under the Type A query, what is the length of the DNS query message? (Hint: use UDP length, UDP header size and DNS header size).
	UDP header is 8 bytes and dns header is 12 bytes. UPD length is 45.
	DNS query message length = 45-8-12 = 25 bytes

3. What is the IP address returned for the Type A query? What was the TTL value? How many answers were returned? 	Under standard query response ->DNS ->Answers, The ip address is 18.66.57.26.
	The ttl value is 126.
	5 answers were returned

4. What is the canonical name returned for the Type CNAME query? What was the TTL value? What was the additional information observed in the response? 
	d2jj6g4vsh8eh.cloudfront.net
	ttl value = 126 seconds
	There was no additional information observed in the response

5. What is the authoritative DNS server's name returned for the type NS query? What was the ttl value? What was the additional information observed in the response? 
	ns1.pesuniversity.com
	ttl is 126
	There was no additional records

6. What is the canonical host name returned for the Type MX query? What was the TTL value? What was the name of the authoritative DNS server observed in the response? 
	ttl is 126
	Authoritative dns server name is ns1.google.com

7. Given that the DNS query and response use the same header format, how can you tell the difference between a DNS query and response? 
	One difference is in flag.
	Response bit will be 0 for query & 1 for response.

8. Did the client request for recursive query? How can you tell? 
	Yes, client requested for recursive query. Check flags. Recursion desired flag was set in DNS queries.

9. Did the DNS server support recursive query? How can you tell
 DNS response=> Flags =>.... .... 1... ....= Recurrision available server can do recurrsive queries.

10. What was the throughput under type NS combining the DNS query and its response?
	(68+126)/(1.83435303 - 2.10382641) =-719.9226877
